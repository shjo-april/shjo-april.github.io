## About Me

I lead AI research and development at [OGQ](https://ogqmarket.naver.com/), where I have been building practical and interpretable machine learning systems since 2017. My work focuses on designing models that go beyond academic benchmarks—aiming instead for tangible, real-world impact through robustness, transparency, and usability.

Since 2021, I have been fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kyungsu Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RbJDbtgAAAAJ&hl=en), whose mentorship has shaped my thinking around **explainable AI**, **data-efficient learning**, and **research integrity**. Under his guidance, I’ve deepened my pursuit of AI that is not only powerful but also understandable and responsible.

My long-term goal is to develop AI technologies that meaningfully contribute to the world—anchored in a strong sense of **collaboration**, **independence**, and **ethics** as a researcher.
