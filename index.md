## About Me

I lead AI research and development at [OGQ](https://ogqmarket.naver.com/), where I have been building practical and interpretable machine learning systems since 2017. My work focuses on designing models that go beyond academic benchmarks—aiming instead for tangible, real-world impact through robustness, transparency, and usability.

Since 2021, I have been fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Kyungsu Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RbJDbtgAAAAJ&hl=en). As an external researcher in the [SNU AIBL Lab](https://aibl.snu.ac.kr/), I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate closely and receive continued mentorship. His guidance has deeply shaped my thinking around explainable AI, data-efficient learning, and research integrity. Under his supervision, I’ve pursued AI that is not only powerful but also understandable and responsible.

<!-- My long-term goal is to develop AI technologies that meaningfully contribute to the world—anchored in a strong sense of collaboration, independence, and ethics as a researcher. -->
