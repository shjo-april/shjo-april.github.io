## About Me

I lead AI research and development at [OGQ](https://www.ogqcorp.com/), where I have been building practical and interpretable machine learning systems since 2017. My primary focus is on designing models that prioritize tangible real-world impact through robustness, transparency, and usability rather than chasing purely academic benchmarks.

Since 2021, I have been conducting research under the supervision of [Prof. Kyungsu Kim](https://aibl.snu.ac.kr/team/pi-information) at the [SNU AIBL Lab](https://aibl.snu.ac.kr/). This collaboration has deeply influenced my approach to explainable AI and data-efficient learning. Integrating these insights, I strive to develop AI systems that are not only powerful but also understandable and responsible.
